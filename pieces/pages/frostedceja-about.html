                <p class="frosted-text frosted-about-text frosted-show" style="text-align: left;">Hi, I'm Afton Ceja,
                    and I've always had a
                    passion
                    for capturing
                    the moments that
                    matter most. From a
                    young age, I remember filming family trips, holidays, and special occasions, then editing them into
                    videos to preserve those memories. What I cherished most was seeing the smiles on my loved ones'
                    faces
                    as they watched those videos, reliving the happiness and joy of those moments together.
                    It's that feeling of connection, of sharing a memory over and over again, that drives me. I want to
                    create something similar for youâ€”to help you hold onto the happiest moments of your life in a way
                    that
                    you can revisit and relive time and time again. My goal is to craft a piece that encapsulates the
                    joy,
                    love, and laughter of your most cherished days, so you can always have a beautiful reminder of your
                    happiest memories.
                    Let me help you tell your story in a way that lasts forever.</p>
