            <p class="frosted-text frosted-about-text">Hi, I'm Afton Ceja, and I've always had a passion for capturing
                the moments that
                matter most. From a
                young age, I remember filming family trips, holidays, and special occasions, then editing them into
                videos to preserve those memories. What I cherished most was seeing the smiles on my loved ones'
                faces
                as they watched those videos, reliving the happiness and joy of those moments together.
                It's that feeling of connection, of sharing a memory over and over again, that drives me. I want to
                create something similar for youâ€”to help you hold onto the happiest moments of your life in a way
                that
                you can revisit and relive time and time again. My goal is to craft a piece that encapsulates the
                joy,
                love, and laughter of your most cherished days, so you can always have a beautiful reminder of your
                happiest memories.
                Let me help you tell your story in a way that lasts forever.</p>
